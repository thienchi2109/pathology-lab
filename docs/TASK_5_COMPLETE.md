# ✅ Task 5 Complete: Dictionary API Routes

## What Was Built

### 6 API Endpoints (All GET)
1. **GET /api/dicts/kit-types** - List all active kit types
2. **GET /api/dicts/sample-types** - List all active sample types  
3. **GET /api/dicts/companies?search=** - List companies with optional search
4. **GET /api/dicts/customers?search=** - List customers with optional search (includes company relation)
5. **GET /api/dicts/categories** - List all active categories
6. **GET /api/dicts/costs** - List cost catalog (includes kit_type and sample_type relations)

### TypeScript Types
Created `types/database.ts` with interfaces for:
- KitType, SampleType, Company, Customer, Category, CostCatalog, User

### Test Data Seeded
- 5 Kit Types (PCR-WSSV, PCR-EHP, PCR-EMS, etc.)
- 5 Sample Types (Water, Shrimp, Feed, Soil, Plankton)
- 5 Companies (CP, Việt Úc, Minh Phú, etc.)
- 4 Customers (linked to companies)
- 4 Categories (Disease, Water Quality, etc.)
- 6 Cost Records (kit/sample combinations)

## Key Features

✅ **Search functionality** on companies and customers (by name, code, email)  
✅ **Relationships** - customers include company data, costs include kit/sample types  
✅ **Active filtering** - only returns `is_active = true` records  
✅ **Sorted results** - alphabetically by name  
✅ **Error handling** - Vietnamese error messages  
✅ **Type safety** - Full TypeScript types

## How to Test

See `scripts/test-api-dicts.md` for detailed testing instructions.

Quick test:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- http://localhost:3000/api/dicts/kit-types
- http://localhost:3000/api/dicts/companies?search=CP
- http://localhost:3000/api/dicts/customers

## What's Different from Plan

**Deferred to later tasks:**
- Server-side caching (Task 16 - Performance Optimization)
- API tests (Task 17 - Error Handling & Testing)

These are optimizations we'll add once core functionality is complete.

## Next: Task 6 - Kit Inventory Management

Now we'll build the first **mutation endpoints** with RBAC:
- POST /api/kits/bulk-create (editors only)
- POST /api/kits/bulk-adjust (editors only)
- GET /api/kits/availability (all users)

This is where we'll see RBAC in action - viewers will get 403 Forbidden on POST requests!

**Progress**: 50% (5/10 core tasks complete)  
**Time**: ~15 minutes for Task 5  
**Files Created**: 8 (6 API routes + 1 types file + 1 seed script)
